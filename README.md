# purrfect-match
A basic landing page made with HTML & CSS.
This was an exercise from Colt Steele's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>. You can also find this page and the code at my <a href="https://codepen.io/stitchybun/pen/ZxVRgX">codepen</a>.
I modified a few things from the original exercise:<ul>
  <li>Added a new font to the brand.</li>
  <li>Added social media icons to the navbar.</li>
  <li>Changed the background image.</li>
  <li>Changed the text shadows.</li>
  <li>Changed the button to display a different cat related pun each time the page is visited.</li>
